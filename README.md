# Machine Learning
Marking down my career of Machine Learning

## Linux Learning 
When I use server to train my own network, I find out that perfecting myself in using linux is importance.So this documentory marks my some knowledges of linux usage. 

## Machine-learning concept 
This documentory marks some concepts that I firstly heard of.

## Python Learning
I hope that I can improve my programming skills while get into the pool of maching learning.

## PyTorch Learning
marks down some useful skill or new knowledges about pytorch.

## Tensorflow Learning 
Although I always use pytorch to set up my network, I think tensorflow is also neccessary.

## ResNet-cifar10
I set ResNet18 with dataset cifar10 to get familiar with setting up network 

## cnn_mnist
firstly using cnn with pytorch to do with mnist.
